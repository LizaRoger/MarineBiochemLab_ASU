# Where to find us

The lab is located on the third floor of the Rob and Melani Walton Center for Planetary Health (aka WCPH, aka ISTB7).

As you exit the elevator, the School of Ocean Futures' offices and labs are on the left, through the glass door. You will need SunCard access to enter. 
If you take the stairs to the 3rd floor, the access to the School of Ocean Futures is on the right. You will need SunCard access to enter.

The large share open plan lab visible to the left of the bullpen is where our benches and aquaria room are located. Before you are granted SunCard access to this space, you will need to complete all the required lab safety trainings.
To find the aquaria room once you are inside the lab, take the corridor to the right towards the freight elevator. The aquaria room is the door on the right, just before the freight elevator.

My office is located in room #322 which is a few doors down from the entrance to the shared open plan lab.
